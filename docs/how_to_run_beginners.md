## Processing Episodes

Episodes are processed **on-demand** when you request it. This saves resources and prevents accidental processing.

### How to Process an Episode

1. Open an episode in your podcast app
2. In the episode description, tap **"Process this episode (remove ads)"**
3. A progress page opens in your browser
4. When it says **"Episode Ready"**, close the tab
5. Return to your podcast app and refresh the feed
6. Play the ad-free episode

### Auto-Process (Optional)

Enable **Auto process new episodes** in show settings to automatically process new episodes when they're released.
