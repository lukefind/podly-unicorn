## Versioning Rule (Corrected)

Do NOT blindly “use the latest versions”.

- Prefer the project’s existing version constraints and lockfiles.
- Upgrade dependencies only when requested or when required to fix a confirmed issue.
- Any upgrade must be scoped, tested, and documented (why, what changed, risk).
